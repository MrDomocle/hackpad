# Presentation of the GamePad

![3D render of the GamePad](render.png?raw=true "The GamePad, 3D render")

I wanted to make this macropad because I have a small desk, with a pretty large 100% keyboard, so making this Hackpad will allow me to play games or use softwares with a much smaller minimalist keyboard in order to have more room to move the mouse, and to be able to access almost every important keys without having to move my hand too much. It was also a good opportunity to learn PCB desing and 3D modeling, which I had a lot of fun with.
