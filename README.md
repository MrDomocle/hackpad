# About
This is a keyboard that works like the ones on old keypad phones - keys 2-9 have 3 or 4 letters on each of them, and you input each letter by pressing the number repeatedly until your desired letter shows up.
I have plans to implement a predictive text mode, but this is quite complex and I definitely don't have the time to do that right now.
